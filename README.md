# README Creator
The aim of this project is to create a command-line application that can dynamically generate a professional README file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## Functionality
The application can be started by inputting the following in the command line or terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

The user then follows the prompt questions by providing answers to the questions prompted on the command-line. The answers are then used to generate the README file. All prompted questions need to be answered for the application to generate the README file.

## Installation
For the application to work in your environment, you will need to initialize npm to set-up a package.json file:

```bash
npm init
```

You will then need to npm install the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

```bash
npm install inquirer@^8.0.0
```
